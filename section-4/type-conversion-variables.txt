Type Conversion in Variables

Casting- convert 1 type to another
2- types of casting
-implicit casting
-explicit casting




-implicit casting
--for integers you can assign a smaller data type to a larger data type

※※※※※※ example- byte->short->int->long->float->double※※※※※※

-- no auto conversion from numeric type to char or bool; int type into char or string type though or into bool

-char and bool aren't compatible



EX: -- works becuase byte is smaller than short
byte cars_byte = 4;
short cars_short = cars_byte;


-explicit casting

Assign val of larger data type to smaller data type we 

Cast Operator:
double x = 24; // x is a double but needs to be an int 
int y; // so we set up a recepticle y whose type is "int"
y = (int)x;// then equal y's value and put "int" in () so that the computer knows whihch type to convert x(double) to.

Convert Class:
double x = 24;
int y;
y = Convert.ToInt32(x); // just use a method here (more code but more clear) still need a var with the type "int" to that will hold the value of the converted value:

Example of the methods that let us convert to differet types:
※Remeber: the variable to which you will assign the convernted value's type must match the type to which the other value will be converted.
double x = 24; // is a double 
int y; // we set up an int var y to which we will assign x's val
y = (int)x// because y's type is "int" the type to which we must convert x must be "int" as well or there will be an error
 
Convert.ToByte()
Convert.ToSByte()
Convert.ToInt16()
Convert.ToInt32()
Convert.ToInt64()
Convert.ToUInt16()
Convert.ToUInt32()
Convert.ToUInt64()
Convert.ToChar()
Convert.ToString()
Convert.ToSingle()
Convert.ToDoble()
Convert.ToDecimal()


All types can be covnerted to strings:
Example:

double x = 24;
int y = 12;
float z = 6;
char t = "+"

string s = x.ToString(); // we first establish s as string whose val is equal to x's value as a string

we then reassign values like below: // we don't have to do this it like this
// we could add a bunch of other strings that would accept each conversion but, since that would require writing "string" 4 times and thinking of 4 different variable names we jsut did it for speed.
s = y.ToString();
s = z.ToString();
s = t.ToString();
