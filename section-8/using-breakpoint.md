using break point


**Breakpoints** are red dots you can click to ad at the left side grey section of the code window. When you do this starting from the line where you put the red dot you run each line of code 1 by 1 by doing f10.

**immediate window**
- you can then check variable values in this window by typing in the variable name 

- 3 different kinds of erros in C#
1. Syntax Errors 
2. RunTime Errors
3. Logic Erros

Access Imediate Window
Debug-->Windows-->Immediate


-Details of 3 types of erros
1. Syntax Errors 
- easiet to fix
-

2. RunTime Errors
- applications crashes during this and visul studio will tell us line of the error
- quick to solve 


3. Logic Errors - these are less errors because there is nothing technically wrong with the code you wrote its just an "error" in that it is doing something but not exactly what you want; Visual Studio won't give an error for these.
- hardest errors to find, and solve


Watch Window -(ultra useful in my opinion)
- to access must have the program "started" 
- then go to Debug --> Window --> Watch

Using Watch Window
- right click on variables and "add to watch window"
- run/advance each line of code and you can see how the variable
  values update.
- usfuel for seeing how your value formuals are calculated
