What C# does is combine the rapid development capabilities of VB with the power of C++. 


Why use encapsulation in C#?
-- lets you hide data and program behavior from users.
--you can group, properties methods and other memebers so that they are treated as a single object
-prevent user of a class from manipulating program obs in ways they were not intended by the designer or dev
-hides how a program operates without affecting its funcitonality an allowing users to service requests for functionality and add or modify internal data or methods to meet changing needs.
-an example ould be: you have an obj called "Patient" that has patient-realted data; you can use encapsulation to provision patient-specififc data to those who need it without exposiing all pateient data. 
-also improves you're code's reusability.

What is C# used for?
-its a gnereal purpose programaing language that you can use ot build a wide range of programs and apps.
-make web apps, game development.
-web apps dev: you can build dynamic websites adn apps using .NET or another open-source platform of your choice.
-MS created C# for MS, so it is a popular language from building windows apps. 
-C# is also popoular lanauge ot use in game-building, especially with Unity, a game engine that runs on C++ and C#


What is a constructor and descructor?
CONSTRUCTORS
-method is a block of code that contains a series of statements.
-Porgrams run by executing mehtods.
-A constructor is a special method of a class that is automatically called whenever an instance of a given class is created. 
-constructor cntains the instructions that execute when an object is created (you can change changable attributes you set up in the class)
-devs use it to assign specififc intitial values to the data mmeber of the same class
-C# will give you a complie-time error if you try to read from an uninitialized variable
-you must first initialize your vars by giging them an initial value which the constructor does

DECONSTRUCTORS
-are methods used to destroy instances of a class when they are no loger needed
-they are called implicitly by the garbage collector in .NET
