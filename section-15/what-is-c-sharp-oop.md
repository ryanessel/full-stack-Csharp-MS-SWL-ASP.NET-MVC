What is c# oop?

OOP object oriented programing

- tries to fix this problem by
  creating networks of objects
  each like a small software
  machine

- these objects are naturally 
  smaller entities simplifing 
  the devlopment task of each unit

- when the obj cooperate in a system
  they become the building blocks of 
  a more complex solution


Analogy for OOP
-
car-
is a bunch of small machines/small bits of software
each parts is created seperatly, tested, then assembled to make
the car or program

Wheel has multiple key value pairs (has multiple properties)

Javascript obj example

â€»Something like this but you don't make objs like this in C#
-----------------------------------------------------
const wheel {

    tire: "rubber",
    rim: "alloy steel",
    brake: "racing breaks",
    breakePad: "brandNameHere,
    bolts: 6

}
-----------------------------------------------------

OOP is making things in to components and putting them in one
big program


**FAQ regarding C# OOP, MS SQL & ASP.NET MVC**
What is C#?
- general purpose OOP prgrm lange
- designed around 2k by Msft as part of
  it .NET initiative

- .NET framwork and .NET apps are multiplat
  apps that you can use with progrming lange
  suck as C++, C# and VB and COBOL.

- C# is open-source and as desinged to be simple
  yet, modern andlexible yet pwrfl and veristale
  yet east to learn and prgrm with

- C# was deved with usiness and enterprise
  needs in mind. By providing fuctionality 
  to support modern day sotftwre devment such as 
  web apps.



C# vs C++
- Due to .NET framwork C# it combines the power
  of C++ and VB. 
- C# has many new data types, saftey types
  to make usre you don't unknowling resue
  initialized variables. 
- Uses simplifed syntax, saves time comapred C++
  complex code
- C# removes memory management issues thanks to
  .NET's garbage colleciton scheme. 
- no need to reference items for garbage 
  collection; system can reclaim memory
  as required

Why use encapsulation in C#?
**Encap (Encapsulation)**
- encap can be used in c# to hide data and
  program behavior from users
- with encap you can group, props, methods,
  and other memebers so that they are treated
  as a single obj.
- encap hides how a program operates
  without affecting functionality while
  still allowing users to service requests
  for functinality and oadd or modify
  internal data or methods to meet changing 
  needs.
- For example, suppose you have an obj called 
  "Pateient" that contains pateint related data.
   Using encap you can hide patient-spefific data
   to those who need it without exposing all
   patient data. improves reusability

What is SQL and how is it used?
- SQL stands for structered query lanague.
- it is used to manage data in relational
  dbs(databases)
- allows one to query, manipulate and define data
  in a relation db.
- has become standard language, meaning that
  the lanaguage the  db uses will be based 
  on SQL despite which relation db you use.
- This make it a very versatile language and 
  important skill to have if you work with dbs
  or data. 
- the language clsoely resmbles English, making it
  easy for English speakers to  learn and read at
  a glance, even for a beginner.
- Statemes consist of clauses,idefities, operators
  and constants.
- together you can create statements such as 
**"SELECTcustomer_nameFROM Purchase_Table WHERE order_number = 253"**
- the satament above is readable by a computer and
  easiably understandable if you understand english

Jobs that use SQL
- many carrer paths benefits from knowing SQL
- Almost any industry hate uses data can benefit from
  someone that specializes in relation databases.
- some job specififcally focus on working with a database, such
  as Database Manager or Database Develper role.
- However, more and more jobs that do not soley concentrate on database
  maintenance require knowledge of SQL.
- Mostly all websites and applicaitons use a database, so various
  dev positions require knowlesge of SQL.
- Also, careers that involve working with data require
  skills in SQL.
- careers such as Data Scientist, Database Dev, DB admin, Business Analysts
  big data architecs

What is sql injection?
- common hacking technique
- it uses SQL commands to manipuate a db.
- it can happen wehn an app has been poorly deved and allows
  useser to isert info directly into a db.
- Example: if you ask a user to submit their name, a hacker can
  type an SQL command instead.
- If that command directly exxecutes against the db of the app an 
  injection attacked has a occured.
- for a db a command is a command and it cannot determine whether a command
  from a valid user or not. 
- because this is a common threat, it is easy to prevent.
- A golden rule of db management is to never input user data directly into
  the db.
- Many progamming languages with have a funciton that checks for SQL
  injections. So it is pretty easy to guard yourself against an SQL attack.

How long does it take to learn SQL?
- takes 2 weeks to a month to learn the basics if you are dedicated.
- however to be comfortable in non-trivial operations it takes a few montths
  to get your bearngs in SQL.
- Because SQL is so close to the English lanague it is not hard to read
  write and understand
- Reading SQL is only one aspect, it is more important to know how to 
  structure data and manage relationships between tables.

What is the best SQL cert?
- maybe any of them

What is best way to learn SQL?
- Practice.

What is a relation db?
- it is a type of db that stores data that is organized in structures
  called tables and these tables are related to oneanother though defined
  relationships.
- each table has columns and rows.
- columns represent attriburtes and define a structure to the data. 
- Each row is a record of info stroed in the table.
- The relationships between tables are defined by assiging certain columsn
  as foreign and primary keys.
- For example a vehicle table might contain the VIN number a a primary key
  since that uniquely identifies each record of information about a car. 
- there may be another table in the db called dealerships.
- The data can be structured in such a way that each car belongs to some 
  dealership.
- The realtipnship between these to tables can be organized by having 
  dealership's key in the vehicles table.

What are morst common forms of SQL and how do they differ?

- there are many forms of SQL, but postgreSQL, Microsfot SQL, and MySQL are 3 
  most widely used.
- each ofthese forms is an implimentation of SQL, their standards are set
  by different organizations.
- PostgreSQL and MySQL are both open source platforms mainatained by a
  wide community of devs while Mcsft devs Mcsft SQL.
-  an example, Microsoft SQL server uses GETDATE(), MySQL uses CURDATE(), and PostgreSQL uses CURRENT_DATE(). They also differ in languages supported; MySQL supports languages that PostgreSQL and Microsoft SQL don't, such as Haskell and Ruby. As Microsoft SQL is proprietary, it costs money to license
