What is c# oop?

OOP object oriented programing

- tries to fix this problem by
  creating networks of objects
  each like a small software
  machine

- these objects are naturally 
  smaller entities simplifing 
  the devlopment task of each unit

- when the obj cooperate in a system
  they become the building blocks of 
  a more complex solution


Analogy for OOP
-
car-
is a bunch of small machines/small bits of software
each parts is created seperatly, tested, then assembled to make
the car or program

Wheel has multiple key value pairs (has multiple properties)

Javascript obj example

â€»Something like this but you don't make objs like this in C#
-----------------------------------------------------
const wheel {

    tire: "rubber",
    rim: "alloy steel",
    brake: "racing breaks",
    breakePad: "brandNameHere,
    bolts: 6

}
-----------------------------------------------------

OOP is making things in to components and putting them in one
big program
