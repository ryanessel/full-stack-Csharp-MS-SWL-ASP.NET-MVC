Normalization
- is a technique of organizing data in a database
- systematic approach to decontructing tables to eliminate data redundancy/repition
  as well as managing undesriable characteristics:
   - insertion 
   - uopdate 
   - deletion
Removes duplicated data from the relation tables
- Nomralization is used for 2 purposes:
 1. eliminating redundant or usless data
 2. ensuring data dependencies make sense.

- without normalization
 - database systems can be inaccurate
 - slow 
 - inefficient
 - overly complex without normalization





Normalization Forms
- normalization guidelines are divided into normal forms; think of form as the format or 
  the way a database structure is laid out.
(First Normal Form (1NF))
(Second Normal Form (2NF))
(Thid Normal Form (3NF))

All forms inherit rules from each other starting from the 2nd normal form inheritnign from the 1st normal form
