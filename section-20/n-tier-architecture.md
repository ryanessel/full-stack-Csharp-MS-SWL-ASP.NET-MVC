N-tier architecture
- a client server architecture concept in software
  engineering, where the presentaiton, processing and 
  data management funcitons are both logically
  and physically separated.

  - means each functions are running on a separate machine; or separate clusters
    so that each is able to provide the services at top capacity since there is no
    resource sharing. 
- speration makes managing each separatly easier since doing work on one doesn't affect
  the other.
- this isolates any problem that might occur in the separate machine or cluster.
- N in N-tier refers to a number of tiers or layers that are being used like 2 tier 3 tier 4 tier etc.
- its also called multi tiered architecture or multi layered architecture 

- N-tier architecture usually divides and applicaiton in to 3 Tiers
  1. Presentaiton tier(or layer) - top most level of the app usually the user interface.
                                   this layer contains Forms or web pages 
                                   purpose is to transalate task and results into something
                                   the user can udnerstand

  2. Logic tier -coordinates the app process commands, makes logical decisions and evaluations 
                 and preforms calculations. It also moves and processes data between the data layer
                 and the presentaion layer. 



  3. Data tier - is the database layer
                 the layer that does the databae processing and there are some
                 database types; oracle, access, MS-SQL, or PostgreSQ.
                 There are different ways to access this database in visual studio.
                 For example: Link or ETTO(EDDO?).NET 



Gonna make a project using multi-tier (n-tier) architecture with  **MS-SQL** and in **Link**

Then we learn design patterns project using multi-tier (n-tier) architecture with  **MS-SQL** and in **Etto(Eddp).NET**
